    <h3><span>Hello! I am Yue Wang. A Designer based in Los Angeles, CA. Welcome to my page.</h3>
    <p>
      I graduated from Loyola Marymount University with a degree in Graphic Design. I am working as a design assistant at a kid's clothing company in Burbank. The computer I use is MacBook Pro.

      I was nervous when I started this class because I've never done coding before so everything is new to me. However, when I follow along the class videos everything makes sense. I didn't watch the class video when I try to find Terminal on my computer so I had to Google it. But overall, I haven't encounter any major challenge.
